# complexEigenPairSolver
Sourcecode for solving complex eigenvalue and eigenvector problems.

This code can solve the eigenvalue and eigenvectors with complex values. 
The input matrix can be real or complex valued. Resulting output vectors can be real or complex valued depending on the input.

eigHqrTest.cpp contains three use cases that demonstrate how the eigen pair solver can be utilized.
